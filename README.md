## Prerequisites
### Environment
* Windows 10
* Torch 1.4.0
* CUDA 11.1
* Python 3.6.5

### Training data
link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n4YGVRhNabM5td4et9o5sw    code: wnvl

## Training
### 1st training stage
Case1 : Update soon

Case2 : We upload our 1st pseudo labels in Training data, you can directly use our offered <stage1_training_map> as pseudo labels for convenience. 

### 2nd training stage
#### setting the training data to the proper root as follows:

```
NSALWSS -- datasets -- DUTS_pseudo -- DUTS-TR-Image -- 10553 samples
                
                -- pseudo labels -- stage1_training_map -- 10553 pseudo labels
                
                                 -- stage2_training_map -- 10553 pseudo labels (not necessary but we also offered stage2's pseudo labels for convenience)
```

#### training

```Run train.py```

## testing
```Run test_code.py```
You need to configure your desired testset in ```--test_root```

The evaluation code can be found in [here](https://github.com/jiwei0921/Saliency-Evaluation-Toolbox).

## Saliency maps & Checkpoint
We offer our saliency maps and checkpoints.
